# Python-Template
A basic template for python.                                                                                                                                           
I don't take any legal responsibility for what you do with this. This is a simple template, you choose the code!

# Installation
Go into the folder where this is installed, press the address bar, but not on a folder, and then you will see the file address. Type in cmd.exe and then in the black box type: pip install -r requirements.txt . After that type in py script.py

# Lisence
This uses the Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal lisence. If you want to use this go ahead! You can reach me on discord at @4lett
